A full stack 
## :thinking: Why I built this

While attending LearningFuze's Accelerated Full Immersion Web Development Bootcamp I found myself using
apps like Brainscapes and Quizlet to study the information I was learning. I wanted to create a flash card
app for myself and future students to use and study with. I also wanted to create something that felt more
immersive with a classroom/supplies theme and CSS animations. The buddy and instructor cats in the app are based on my
two cats, Bacchus and Apollo!
