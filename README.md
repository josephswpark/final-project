# Sneaker World

A full-stack web application for sneakers to purchase rare sneakers.

## Why I built this :thinking: 
Growing up, I always loved sneakers except I wasn't able to afford any of it, which made my desire to collect sneakers grew. As I collected my personal sneakers, I also started reselling limited and rare sneakers. As I used applications such as OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace, I wanted to create an E-Commerce website so that I can directly sell my sneaker inventory to consumers.
